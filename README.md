# Anime Battle CLI

Welcome to Anime Battle CLI, a dynamic and interactive command-line role-playing game where you face off against a series of anime-themed bosses. The game leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate unique game scenarios, dialogues, and introductions, ensuring a fresh adventure every time you play.

## Features

- **Dynamic Story Generation**: Every playthrough is unique, with game data, intros, and dialogues generated by an LLM.
- **Turn-Based Combat**: Engage in classic turn-based battles against a variety of bosses.
- **CLI Interface**: A retro, colorful, and interactive command-line interface built with Cobra.
- **Modular & Idiomatic Go Code**: The project follows Go best practices with a clear and organized structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.20 or higher)
- A valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/awesomeProject1.git
    cd awesomeProject1
    ```

2.  **Set up your environment variable:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
    Alternatively, you can set it directly in your shell:
    ```sh
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

## Usage

To start your adventure, run the `play` command:

```sh
go run main.go play
```

This will initiate the game, generate the story, and plunge you into battle. Follow the on-screen prompts to make your choices and fight the bosses.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

-   `main.go`: The entry point of the application.
-   `go.mod`, `go.sum`: Go module files for dependency management.
